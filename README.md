A JavaScript API to scrape and analyze bills in Congress. (Updated for the 115th Congress)

## Why?
The current repository for bulk bill data is horrible to use for both citizens and developers. As shown in the gif below, bills are uploaded as XML files in a giant folder, which makes programming any projects that involves congressional data cumbersome.

## What does this project do
 * Returns full Congressional bill text and metadata from Congress.gov as JSON. For example, it converts the XML (on the left) into concise, usable JSON (on the right)

 * Parses bills for key points and ideas.
 * Powerful filtering and searching.
